    "- To bridge the gap between your understanding of the questions and the expectations of the interviewer. \n",

    "You want to design a search engine that displays the most relevant results in response to user queries.\n",
    "Questions you may want to ask are:\n",
    "    - Is it a general search engine (Google) or a specialized search engine (Amazon product search)?\n",
    "    - What kind of queries is it expected to answer?\n",
