    "## 1. Set up the problem\n",
    "Usually, the problem at hand is generally very broad. The first thing you wan't to do is ask questions. Why?\n",
    "- To bridge the gap between your understanding of the questions and the expectations of the interviewer. \n",
    "- Narrow down your problem space\n",
    "- Chalk out system requirements\n",
    "- Arrive at a precise problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "You want to design a search engine that displays the most relevant results in response to user queries.\n",
    "Questions you may want to ask are:\n",
    "    - Is it a general search engine (Google) or a specialized search engine (Amazon product search)?\n",
    "    - What kind of queries is it expected to answer?\n",
    "    \n",
    "From the findings, you can then define a precise problem statement as follows:\n",
    "> Build an ML model that allows a generic search engine to return relevant results for queries like \"Elon Musk\", \"Prog Languages\" etc."

    "- **Latency Requirements:** Do you want to return the relevant tweets in 100 milliseconds or 500 ms? Knowing that you need to return results quickly will inform the depth and complexity of your models.\n",
    "- **Scale of the data:** How many tweets would we have to rank according to relevance for a user at a time? Having huge amounts of data will inform you to design the system with scalability in mind.\n",

    "## 3. Defining Metrics\n",
    "Metrics will help you to figure out if the system is performing well.\n",
    "Think of it as a criteria for measuring success. \n",
    "It's important to discuss metrics early in our design discussions because it helps in understanding the problem and in selecting key architectural components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics for offline testing\n",
    "Offline metrics tests model performance during the development stage. Examples of metrics for binary classification are:\n",
    "- AUC\n",
    "- Log Loss\n",
    "- Precision\n",
    "- Recall\n",
    "- F1-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to come up with specific metrics for certain problems.\n",
    "For example, the performance of a search ranking ML model can be measured using NDCG metric (A measure of ranking quality). \n",
    "\n",
    "> The metric will help you select the best perfoming models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics for online testing\n",
    "Once we've selected the best performing models offline, we need to test them in a production environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment of the new model will depend on its performance in an online test. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Component-wise metric:** This will measure the performance of the model online.\n",
    "- **End-to-end metric:** This will test how well the system is performing with the new model plugged in. Here, user engagement and retention rates are good metrics to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: A model that affects another component.\n",
    "If the component you are designing is going to improve an existing component, you'll have component-wise metrics to evaluate the performance of the model individually. You'll also have to come up with performance metrics for the component that is being affected.\n"
